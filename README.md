# Generative Recurrent Neural Network
### Trained on English text and implemented from scratch in Python
#####Team: Amanda Solis, Noah Martin, Mike Liu

This project explores Recurrent Neural Networks for character-level language modeling. We document the training procedure and our experiments with the network structure (changes in # of hidden units or in sequence length) in the Methods,Results.pdf.

The network was trained on “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens and this text was downloaded for free from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/).
